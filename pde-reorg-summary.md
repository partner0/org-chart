# PDE Org Restructure Summary

## Problem Statement

While leadership (Francois & Gerard) are aligned, this alignment does not consistently translate throughout the organization. The result is a lack of focus, with teams moving in too many directions simultaneously.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Internal Platform vs Customer Facing Products Responsibilities

Establish clear ownership between internal platform OBTs (Platform DevX, Insist, Data, Algo Perf) and customer-facing product OBTs (Core App, Engagement, Oracle, Owners Suite, Signal, Beacon, Tally).

### 2. Engineering-Product Leadership Pairing

Pair Product Directors with technical leaders (Staff Engineers) rather than people managers (Engineering Managers). This reflects feedback from Phil and Jess:
- Phil wants to partner with Jorge or Vincent for technical depth
- Jess wants Michael for AI/platform expertise

The key insight: Product-Engineering collaboration is about value vs. cost/feasibility tradeoffs - a conversation best had between PMs and technical leaders, not people managers.

### 3. Boost Technical Strategy & Leadership

Reduce Francois's direct reports from 8 to 3, enabling increased focus on:
- Leveling up the team on AI tooling
- Driving innovation
- Strategic technical leadership
- Helping develop, adapt, and implement PDE strategy
- External facing due diligence activities
- Supporting enterprise sales and CX efforts

### 4. Elevate Paula's Role

Paula takes on more, higher level responsibilities:
- Engineering operations and organizational design
- Measuring engineering org performance (KPIs)
- Cross-functional collaboration (already strong with Sales/CS)
- Already strong management of managers background (Rita, Vincent)

## Implementation Tiers

### Tier 1 (Q1 2026)
- Paula promoted to Senior Director
- Mariah continues reporting to Francois
- Org structure changes as shown in [the chart](https://partner0.github.io/org-chart/)
- Exploring the possibility of Mila reporting to Paula for improved alignment of internal/external

### Tier 2 (H2 2026 or early 2027)
- Mariah reports to Paula

## Key Org Changes

| Manager | Current | Target | Net Change |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| Francois | 8 direct / 51 total | 3 direct / 53 total | -5 direct |
| Paula | 7 direct / 24 total | 5 direct / 25 total | +Staff (and expanded indirect scope) |
| Vincent | 6 direct | 10 direct | +Platform DevX, +AI Tiger |
| Rita | 11 direct | 10 direct | -Platform DevX, +Beacon |
| Mariah | 7 direct / 11 total | 11 direct / 17 total | +Core App, -Beacon |
| Mila | 4 direct | 6 direct | +Owners Suite (new) |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Mariah's increased scope** (7→11 directs) | Double down on her people management strengths; pair with technical leaders for product discussions; monitor workload closely |
| **Vincent's 40% increase** (6→10 directs) | Vincent has technical leadership skills that complement people management; teams being added (Platform DevX, AI Tiger) are up his skillset; balancing the load between EMs |
| **Mila's satisfaction** | Position Owners Suite as a new technical challenge; leverage her excitement about AI within the product and working with Stephanie; she has expressed desire to remain TLM with current reports |
| **Paula's readiness** | Tiered approach reduces risk; she has the skills but needs growth on KPI/measurement side; already leading talent strategy exercises and managing managers effectively |
| **Change management overall** | Phased rollout; clear communication; monitor and adjust |
| **EM staffing** | We can sustain engineering with current EM staffing, but should Mila choose to go back to IC, we will have to hire |

## Rationale Summary

1. **Effectiveness**: Improve alignment and focus by pairing technical and product leaders
2. **AI Transformation**: Create space for Francois to drive innovation; growth opportunity for Paula
3. **Sustainable Spans**: Target 1:10 EM:IC ratio without adding managers; leverage existing leadership strengths
